A Portfolio Theme

Guides, tools and libraries for modern web development!

    Built on web standards: Work with and extend what's available in modern browsers, learning skills, and writing code that stays relevant.
    Lightweight: Simple solutions that are lightweight and have a low barrier to entry. With extension points for power users.
    Low complexity: Write code that is close to what actually runs in the browser, reducing abstractions and complexity.
The goal for The Project

    Our goal is to provide developers with the guides and tools they need to build for the modern portfolio. 
    This files provide my web development students with files to kick start their web development journey with a good and wonderful portfolio.
    Students are not to copy and just use the code herein
    Students are to use it as a guide and source of inspiration in other to come up with their own designs.
    We aim to work closely with them and them project their skills online for recruiters.
At the same time, we are aware of the fact that not all problems can be solved elegantly by just putting up portfolios today. 
We support recruiters making informed decisions about introducing tools and customizations to their projects, in such a way that developers can upgrade later as browser support improves.
